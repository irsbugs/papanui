# Printers at Te Papanui Enderley Community Trust

Version: 2021-02-11

The printer is a Fuji-Xerox ApeosPort-IV C3373. [Administration Manual](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1063690/Fuji-Xerox-Apeosport-Iv-C5575.html)

The Ubuntu printer driver used is the Generic Postscript Printer Foomatic/Postscript.

The *Career* account has been setup to be able to print documents. The *Enderley* account does not have access to the printer.

For the steps to allow an account to have access to the printer refer to [printer_setup.pdf](printer_setup.pdf)

The printer has the ability to scan pages to a pdf file. This file is then sent as an email attachment. If a gmail account is used to perform the SMTP mail server function then it requires the account to have *less secure app* turned on. 

See the recommendations and discussion on the use of *less secure app*.
